## **1\. Fibonacci Sequence**




The **[Fibonacci sequence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_sequence)** pattern is useful when the solution to a problem depends on the solutions of smaller instances of the same problem.

There is a clear recursive relationship, often resembling the classic Fibonacci sequence `F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2)`.
